# Introduction to Python Programming

When many researchers decide to start learning programming, their language of choice is often Python. This tutorial aims to introduce the Python language, show you what it can do, when you'll want to use it and introduce some basic concepts. This is just a starter and you WILL NOT be an expert within the next hour, but hopefully you'll know how to get started and how to go about learning more skills.

## How Can I Use Python On My Computer?

If you're using a Mac or Unix operating system, python is mostly likely already installed on your computer. To double check and find out which version you have, open up a terminal window and simple type:
```
python --version
```

If you're using Windows, you'll need to download software that allows you to run python. Today we're going to use [spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) as it has a nice graphical user interface (GUI), similar to RStudio. I would recommend the installation option via Anaconda. Mac and Unix users can also download this software if they'd prefer to use the GUI. 

### Python Version 2 vs. Python Version 3

## How Can I Continue Learning Python?!

There are some great free online resources available to help you learn Python (and many other languages). Two of my favourites are:

* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). This has a Python tutorial as well as tutorials in other languages with a focus upon website design. There are free accounts or paid-for accounts with added functionality. 
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). This has tutorials in many different languages as well as coding competitions. It's used by companies to head hunt the best new developers.

If you're willing to spend a little money there are also several good text books available, most of which come with downloadable or online content. An example of some include:

* [Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/). Excerpts of the text are available online for free.  
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/). You can try this one out for free before purchasing.
